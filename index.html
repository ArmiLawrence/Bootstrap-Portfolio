                                I was born in Manila, Philippines and I enjoyed school, movies, TV, and most of all, playing outside during our hot summers.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley many moons ago, with a major in History and minor in City and Regional Planning. 
                                Need for food and shelter hindered my lifelong goal of becoming a hippie, 
                                so I got into maintenance renewals sales. From there, I got into working with data and learned the fun world of Microsoft SQL stack and have been 
                                working with data for the last 6 years. I graduated from the University of Denver's Full Stack Coding Boot Camp. Feel free to browse through my portfolio, and I
                                aim to add more as I create apps for my personal and professional interests. I enjoy learning new technologies and programming languages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As hobbies, I run (very slowly) and practice kickboxing and karate. I believe that martial arts is a good way to improve one's character. 
                                My "normal" people activities are watching new movies on TV or theater, and anime in VRV. 
                                I have no kids, no pets, but don't mind playing with those beings once in a while.

                                Fun Fact: I have a twin sister, she is my clone.
